# What is this?
Hello!
This is a tiny webpage suported with github.io maded by myself, the purpose of this website is generate random characters for decide with what character to play in tekken 8
Maybe you are saying... "Dumbass did you don't now you already have a random picker in the tekken 8?"
Yes, i already know, but with my friends i play one mod for replace the 4th preset of all characeters for mokujin.

And considering that we do tournaments directly online is a bit problematic to catch random pj, especially because we can not turn back to the character selection XD

I leave here the mod:

```https://tekkenmods.com/mod/4897/tekken-8-mokujin-for-all-characters```

I hope this webpage could be helpful if someone uses it for play with mokujin :3

## I'm working in this
I hope the web site will be ready for Christmas xD
